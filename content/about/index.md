*ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ash*

Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by lights.
How they move, change, and create atmosphere. That early spark turned into a lifelong passion for electronics and engineering, and now I get to lead an amazing team as Head of Engineering at [Vivalyte](https://vivalyte.com).

I specialize in building systems around addressable LED pixels, dynamic lighting, and smart control tech. Basically anything that makes light come alive. I love solving tricky hardware/software challenges and turning creative ideas into real, working products.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on pushing the limits of whatâ€™s possible in lighting tech: developing innovative tools, mentoring talented engineers, and collaborating with artists, designers, and dreamers.

Always learning, always tinkering.

**Letâ€™s build something brilliant.**
